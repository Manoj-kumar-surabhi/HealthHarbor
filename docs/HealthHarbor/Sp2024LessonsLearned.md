# Spring 2024 Lessons Learned

## Project Manager
- **Delegate more!** At the start of the semester when there is little organization, a lot of the work is put on the PM. I would create positions immediately for certain tasks, so the PM does not get overwhelmed.
- Someone could be assigned to lead/schedule specific recurring meetings.
- Assigning someone to handle the communication channels such as Discord or Teams.
- I thought it was beneficial to have leadership meetings, with Scrum Masters and Product Owners separately and together. Scheduling with that many people was difficult. I would suggest REQUIRING students to use and update Google Calendar. Many meetings were nearly impossible to schedule because some refused to use a calendar application. I suggest requiring it from the beginning.
- I found the agile ceremonies to be beneficial but there is lots of confusion surrounding the ceremonies.
- Stand up meetings help hold teams accountable.
- Retrospectives allow for reflection on said accountability.
- Sprint Planning allows alignment of goals and tasks for the sprint.
- These ceremonies should not take a full hour and I would put a hard time limit on them if possible.
  - Retrospectives - MAX 30 minutes
  - Stand Ups - MAX 15 Minutes
- If next classes are large enough, I would suggest the PM only holds the PM position. I was holding 3 roles which was too much and was not able to contribute as much as I would have liked to the other teams.

## Scrum Masters
- Start Early.
- Set clear expectations with your team.
- Decide on which agile ceremonies you will be using and schedule meetings early. Try to keep these focused and short.
- Setting meetings can be challenging, make good use of the class time.
- Find a time to meet with your product owner right away.
- Teach your time to use Jira or whatever management software your team chooses.

## Product Owners
- NA

## Data Science Students
- If you have never used GitHub before, make it a priority early in the semester to get familiar with navigating through it and understanding the functionality of how a shared repository works.
- Additionally following the already set up and documented processes for GitHub on the GitHub would resolve many problems.
- Data Science and any programming is a constantly evolving landscape. You will never know everything about all technologies so half your job is researching (Googling :)). If you do not understand some technical things, start investigating! If you are still struggling after looking into it, then reach out to someone with more experience to guide you. But please do your own investigation before asking someone to walk you through it.

## Business Students
- Start early with defined tasks for individuals or small groups. Individual direction can go a long way.
- Do your best to work with the other teams’ business students to make sure that all of you are mainly focused on marketing the product as a whole, not singular applications within the product.
- Anyone can take leadership of the business case document and it is important that somebody takes ownership of the document sooner rather than later.
- A foundation for the business case is super important. Don’t be afraid to dump loads of information in the document during the initial stages.

## Architecture Team
- Start as soon as possible to understand the current technologies.
- Read and make documentation to help teams understand.

## General
- Show up.
- Be present.
- Ask questions.
- Do the readings before class.
- Be professional.
- After having conversations with various individuals from various teams while helping them out I realized that teams in our class lack collaboration within their teams which affected them throughout the semester in terms productivity and every other possible aspect. Moreover, Some teams are having some great individuals on the technical side who keep on pushing great work but others from their team don't even know what is going on with their own features. So I believe even if you are doing great technically but you are not able to utilize resources you have, your team is lacking in that aspect and it will reflect. So collaboration is a must.This is for everyone. I am neither targeting any individual nor any team. Additionally, a lot of us are afraid to ask questions and get clarity from their teammates and the professor which is holding them back. This may be harsh but it is a fact. I don't have any intentions to hurt anyone's feelings so please do well to understand me. Thank you, it was nice working with all of us.
