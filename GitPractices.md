# GitHub Guidlines
## Branching
If you are a developer on your team, you must have Jeff Wall give you access to the repository first.

* We will be using branches to work on our coding tasks. 
    - A branch in github allows you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. 
    - You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository and ours is “main”. 
* Please checkout the main branch which is what the website is running by using the command “git checkout main” 
    - You should already be on this branch if you are just starting
* You must check out a new branch to complete any work, do not make any changes on the main branch
### Create a new branch 
* While you are on the main branch you will run the command git checkout -b  NEW_BRANCH_NAME
* git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME is the correct way to create a new branch and switch to it. 
    - This is a shorthand for creating a branch: git branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME and then checking it out after creation: git checkout NEW_BRANCH_NAME.
* Create new and separate branches for features or tasks, you do not want to put changes on the main branch that will break the site
* Until a feature or task is completed, leave your work on your branch and test it locally.
* As soon as you finished the work and tested it you must create a pull request

### Keeping your new local branch up-to-date with main before you create a pull request
It is always good practice to ensure that your local branch is up-to-date with the lastest edits made to the main branch of the remote repository (i.e., GitHub repository). This will minimize code conflicts. Be sure to do this before performing a pull request on GitHub. To do this:
* run a git pull to get the latest version of the main branch from GitHub to your local repository
* Use the checkout command to move back to the local branch you are working on
* Once in the local branch, use the git merge or git rebase command on your local branch to bring recent updates to main to the local branch (ex. git merge main or git rebase main).

### Merging/Pull Requests
* Once you have completed any work on your branch and have tested it on your computer, you can create a pull request. 
* Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.
* Once your changes are ready, go to the github repository and navigate to pull requests: 
    - Click “New Pull Request”
    - Always select “base: Main” on the left side.  On the right select your branch for “compare: BRANCH_NAME”
    - Type a title and fill out given template for your pull request.
    - Submit Pull Request
* The infrastructure team will have to approve this push request so please contact the team ASAP to get your branch approved and merged
    - Assign anyone on the Infrastructure Team to do your review. 
    - Once you assigned them, send a message in the Infrastructure Discord chat with a link to your pull request
    - Pull Requests should be approved within 24hrs. If you have not recieved input or approval within that time frame contact your scrum master to escalate the request.
* Once approved, the code changes you made will be in the “main” branch
    - In order to see your changes in the main branch, run git pull after running git checkout main again
### Merge Conflicts
* There is a chance that you may run into a Merge Conflict, if this is the case please reach out to Kenzie Baker for assistance
* [More information regarding how this works](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

## Changes from other teams
* Now that you know how to add code to the repository, other teams and developers may be writing code and adding it to the main branch as well. 
* What this means is that everytime you go to work on code or create a new branch there may have been updates from other teams. 
* In order to account for this, before creating a new branch, always check out the main branch first. 
* While you are on the main branch you will run a couple different commands
    - ‘git fetch’ : downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.
    - ‘git pull’ : this calls both git fetch and git merge. It fetches what other changes have been made to the branch and applies them to the branch you are currently working on
    - For our purposes, most of the time, you can just run git pull and then check out your new branch.
